## This Repository is one created for the Classification project by Explore Science Data Academy.

### The project is a competition (Hackathon challenge) held on the Kaggle Data Science community platform,

The metric that was used for this this challenge is a Macro F1_score with a passmark in relation to your score being above 0.65 (0% achieved if score is below 0.65, 50% achieved at 0.65 and 100% achieved for a score of 0.75 and above).

(Bear in mind the challenge is still on going, however, currently my Macro f1_score  = 0.75047...This score is poised to change as the current score is calculated with 80%. The final result will be based on the other 20% of the dat)
